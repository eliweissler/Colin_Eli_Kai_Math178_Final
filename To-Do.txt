Goal: predict activity someone is doing (regardless of user)

compare naive to correctly mapped approach

To Do List:

feature vectors:
- script now exists in repo, pickled vectors and labels are in the drive

Naive Approaches:
- Colin is working on them with the feature vectors
-- SVM is "done"

try Naive Approaches, as shown in the paper (Hand-crafted Features vs Residual Networks for Human Activities Recognition using Accelerometer)
- SVM and k-NN on raw data, results should be similar to paper
- trees classifier on raw data: not in the paper, but would be interesting
-- paper creates 3 (ax, ay, az) vectors for the accelerometer data with 128 samples. there is 50% overlap between the segments of 128 data points.
--- ex: feature 1: minute 1 to minute 5. feature 2: minute 3 to minute 7. etc...

figure out how to map to tangent plane correctly
- option 1: mapping the data to the plane, testing with our classifiers in the plane, get results 
- option 2: mapping the data to the plane, train in the plane
-- map the model back to the manifold, so that way all future data doesn't need to be mapped
--- don't know if this is possible...


stretch goals:
re-wire the DNN jupyter notebook for our the motion sense dataset
fundamental limit of deep learning:
- number of data points needed vs performance
