Goal: predict activity someone is doing (regardless of user)

compare naive to correctly mapped approach

To Do List:

Naive Approach
- trees
- SVM and k-NN are done 

Set up script to do train/test on data based on user.

Fix overleaf - update it 


figure out how to map to tangent plane correctly
- option 1: mapping the data to the plane, testing with our classifiers in the plane, get results 
- option 2: mapping the data to the plane, train in the plane
-- map the model back to the manifold, so that way all future data doesn't need to be mapped
--- don't know if this is possible...


stretch goals:
re-wire the DNN jupyter notebook for our the motion sense dataset
fundamental limit of deep learning:
- number of data points needed vs performance


writing:
- add in naive approach verification processes.
-- elaborate more on the hand crafted features paper in our explanation.
-- got within an std of their results so good enough
- add in goal of robustness
-- combining multiple datasets for train/testing
