Goal: predict activity someone is doing (regardless of user)

compare naive to correctly mapped approach

To Do List:


parse mobi-act dataset

run one fold user cross val on the processed mobi act dataset


figure out how to map to tangent plane correctly
- option 1: mapping the data to the plane, testing with our classifiers in the plane, get results 
- option 2: mapping the data to the plane, train in the plane
-- map the model back to the manifold, so that way all future data doesn't need to be mapped
--- don't know if this is possible...


stretch goals:
re-wire the DNN jupyter notebook for our the motion sense dataset
fundamental limit of deep learning:
- number of data points needed vs performance


writing:
- how datasets were combined
- background on datasets
