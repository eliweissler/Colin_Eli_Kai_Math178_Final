Goal: predict activity someone is doing (regardless of user)

To Do List:
download and preprocess mobi-act dataset
- how many data points

try Naive Approaches, as shown in the paper (Hand-crafted Features vs Residual Networks for Human Activities Recognition using Accelerometer)
- SVM on raw data, results should be similar to paper
- trees classifier on raw data: not in the paper, but would be interesting

try to find the DNN code used for the paper
- if this fails, use the jupyter notebook network, record the results
- hopefully enough close to the paper..

figure out how to map to tangent plane correctly
- option 1: mapping the data to the plane, testing with our classifiers in the plane, get results 
- option 2: mapping the data to the plane, train in the plane
-- map the model back to the manifold, so that way all future data doesn't need to be mapped
--- don't know if this is possible...

fundamental limit of deep learning:
- stretch goal
- number of data points needed vs performance
