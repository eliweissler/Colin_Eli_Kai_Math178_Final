- example of deep neural network trained and tested on the wisdm dataset (jacky email)
- the jupyter notebook runs and produces 75% accuracy for activity determination. (coremltools I couldn't use, and any instances of 'acc' need to be changed to 'accuracy', but everything worked other than that)
- perhaps we can just modify the code to work on our data?
